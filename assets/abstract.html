                <h3>From outputs to outcomes</h3>
                <p>Abstract started from a question. Specifically, "Why don't designers have proper version control?" And so our first product was born: a tool to manage, version, and document design files in one place.</p>
                

                <p>Since our 2017 launch, Abstract has been the leading platform for file-based design collaboration, helping more than 7,000 companies improve their workflows.</p>

            

                <p>Today, we build products to support the huge portion of a designer’s job that isn’t drawing, kerning, or prototyping. Because design teams deserve their own space to collaborate.</p>

                

                <p>Welcome to Abstract, the design intelligence platform.</p>
